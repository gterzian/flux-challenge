### What's elegance?

If we focus on the ability for others to quickly jump in, understand and contribute to a codebase, these are matters that can be important

- Test coverage
- Use of standard tools

Assuming this, I've focused on covering core logic with tests, using [Jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest/), and I used standard flux libraries such as the Facebook Dispatcher, Container and Store classes found in [flux utils](http://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/flux-utils.html) as well as immutable data structures found in [Immutable](http://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/).

I'm sure there are lots of other great flux tools and frameworks out there, and I also think using ligthweight libraries as opposed to framework can help in getting people to quicky jump in, especially in the case of a young community where no framework is the de-facto framework.

### What's elegance?

If we focus on the ability for others to quickly jump in, understand and contribute to a codebase, these are matters that can be important

- Test coverage
- Use of standard tools

Assuming this, I've focused on covering core logic with tests, using [Jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest/), and I used standard flux libraries such as the Facebook Dispatcher, Container and Store classes found in [flux utils](http://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/flux-utils.html) as well as immutable data structures found in [Immutable](http://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/).

I'm sure there are lots of other great flux tools and frameworks out there, and perhaps using ligthweight libraries can help people to quickly jump in, especially when the community is still young and there is no de-facto standard framework.
